    "**Analyzing the Stance of the Provided Text**\n\nOkay, I've got the task. I need to classify the stance of this text about a fallen Ukrainian soldier, Roman Romaniuk, regarding predefined topics, and output it as JSON. I know this territory. My understanding is that the key to this is a *nuanced* approach.\n\nThe text's focus is crystal clear: the death of a Ukrainian soldier, killed by the Russian Army, and the mourning and gratitude surrounding it. That immediately screams \"Russian Ukrainian Conflict.\" I know the \"target\" for this topic is *Russia's position* – specifically, their justifications for the invasion.\n\nGiven the text's core message – praise for a fallen Ukrainian soldier, inherently positioning him as a victim of Russian aggression – the stance *must* be \"Against\" Russia's position. It’s a direct condemnation of Russia's actions.\n\nNo other topic – not the US 2020 election, Taiwan, or COVID treatments – are even remotely relevant here. I'm seeing a clean classification.\n\nTherefore, the JSON output should be a single classification: \"Russian Ukrainian Conflict\": \"Against\". Easy.\n"
